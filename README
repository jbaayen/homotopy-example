The approach introduced in the paper and illustrated with this example forms the basis of 
KISTERS Real Time Optimization (RTO), an enterprise solution for real-time global optimization
of hydraulic systems.

An earlier version of the continuation method is implemented in the open source software package RTC-Tools.

This code was tested with CasADi 3.5.1.
